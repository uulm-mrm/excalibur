Development
===========

Use the following command to install the library with all required development dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    bash> python3 -m pip install .[develop]
    zsh>  python3 -m pip install .\[develop\]

You can now run the style guide tests with ``flake8`` and the unit tests with ``pytest``.
